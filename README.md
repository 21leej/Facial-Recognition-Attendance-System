# Facial Recognition Attendance System using Deep Learning (Machine Learning) with OpenCV, Django in Python

### What are we trying to build?

An attendance system which uses facial recognition to detect which people are present in any image.

### What are we using? 

1. [Microsoft Face API ](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/cognitive-services/face/)

   

### What do we plan on implementing?

The method of image processing using Face API is very black boxed and does not expose it's implementation. Hence, in future we plan to re-use some code from,
1.[OpenCV-Face-Recognition-Python](https://github.com/informramiz/opencv-face-recognition-python)

* This can be tweaked and modified to make it use ensemble learning to increase accuracy.
* Three Algorithms are mentioned in the projects readme, their respective papers can be found in 'Papers/Face Recognition Algorithms'
